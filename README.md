## xcsoar-setup

Location of files used in the configuration of XCSoar glide computer.

This is a first-cut. The documentation needs to be improved and the process of installation clarfied. There has to a list of .gitignore files to make it easier to disregard information that may leak to this location from someone's actual fligth computer. A good example of this is log files and crash files.

I will also have to consider what files are of personal interest and which are of general interest. For the repository to have broad appeal, there has to be an acceptance of 'standards' such as the names of waypoints and their official locations. How will I differentiate between waypoints that are valuable from year-to-year and those which have value for short periods, such as the locations of farm strips which tend to come and go, or of good agricultural fields which might serve as a landing option at the start of the season but become unsuitable as the crop grows.
